      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        Founded in 2010, Empowering the Nations began as a small local initiative aimed at training individuals
        in essential life and vocational skills. Over the years, our programs have expanded to include a wide
        range of courses, including gardening, sewing, cooking, landscaping, child development, and life skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, we continue to partner with schools, churches, and local businesses to create opportunities
        for youth, women, and community members to develop their potential and achieve independence.
      </p>
