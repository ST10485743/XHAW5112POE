  <section id="history">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Empowering the Nations was founded in 2010 with a clear mission — to uplift and equip communities with practical
      skills that promote independence and sustainable development. What began as a small local project has grown into
      a movement that reaches thousands of people across South Africa and beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, the organization has offered training in areas such as entrepreneurship, gardening, sewing,
      computer literacy, and early childhood development. Empowering the Nations continues to partner with schools,
      churches, and local businesses to create opportunities for individuals, especially women and youth, to build a
      better future for themselves and their families.
